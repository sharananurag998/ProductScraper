# ProductScraper
A simple python web scraper to find prices and ratings of top products on Flipkart.

## To use:-
1. Run scrape.py using python. 
2. A chromium window opens which scrapes Flipkart for prices and ratings of products.
3. The results are stored in products.csv

## Future developments
I'd like to convert this into a machine learning project where products will be ranked according to different parameters.
